## Spell Checker

This program is a spell checker that checks a text file for misspelled words using a hash table.

# > Note--->>>
I have a alternative way to implement speller . Firstly i was not able to implement speller as i am getting a seg fault and can't understant why , secondly I enjoyed the leactures aheah and wanted to start my 
career in Web Dev or AI/ML ,
With that being said a Much more optimal way to solve this problem would be -->> Thin about this that we now how many words are there in the dict.  , now for a moment with me just think of what a word is 
a sequene of characters or much more succintly a unique sequence if character (or/i.e. a unique sequence of chars where that combination is only used once to represent something)
so I thin we could make something where we every char in a string would have a unique ascii int tht we could use to identify each item in array     

## Usage

To use the spell checker, run the following command:

```sh
$ ./speller text_file
